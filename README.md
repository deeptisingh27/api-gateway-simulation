API Gateway Simulation is a simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates core features such as JWT authentication, per-user rate limiting, and service health monitoring in an interactive dashboard.

Live Demo:
Try the project live here: https://deeptisingh27.github.io/api-gateway-simulation/

Features:
1) JWT Authentication Simulation: Login generates a fake token.
2) Per-user Rate Limiting: Users can make a limited number of requests, displayed with a progress bar.
3) Service Health Checks: Mock services show Healthy ✅ or Down ❌, with colors that adapt to dark mode.
4) Dark Mode & Responsive Design: Works on mobile devices with smooth animations and vertical layout.

Technologies:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

How to Run:
1) Clone the repository:
2) Open index.html in any web browser.

Notes:
1) This is a conceptual simulation, not a real backend gateway.
2) Future improvement: implement a real backend using Node.js for authentication, rate limiting, and health checks.
